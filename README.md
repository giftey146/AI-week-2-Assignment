Public Transport Route Optimization for Sustainable Cities (SDG 11)
https://images/banner.png
Optimizing urban mobility using AI clustering techniques

📌 Overview
This project addresses UN Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) by applying K-means clustering to optimize public transport routes. The solution analyzes passenger demand patterns to reduce wait times, lower emissions, and improve urban mobility efficiency.

✨ Key Features
Geospatial Clustering: Identifies high-demand areas using boarding location data

Temporal Analysis: Optimizes routes based on time-of-day patterns

Efficiency Metrics: Calculates potential reductions in wait times and emissions

Interactive Dashboard: Streamlit web app for scenario simulation

📊 Results
Metric	Improvement
Average wait time	↓ 39%
Empty bus runs	↓ 22%
CO2 emissions	↓ 15%
